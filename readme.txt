Oh Rats!

Try to stay alive as long as possible amidst a horde of ravenous rats.  These
rats will stop at nothing to take a bite out of you, even resorting to
cannibalism if the situation is right.  Your only hope is to stomp on them
before they get you.

Use the number pad to move around in the 4 cardinal directions.  The rats have
the added ability to move in 8 directions, but their movements are very
predictable.  Pressing 5 will descend down stairs to the next level, where even
more rats are waiting for your tasty flesh.  Every hit from a rat will take
away 1 HP, and the rat, now gnawing on a chuck of your flesh, will no longer be
a threat and will disappear from the view.  If you move onto a rat, you will
kill it, increase your score, and the rat will disappear.
